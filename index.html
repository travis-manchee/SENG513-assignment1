          <h2>About Me and EZ Recipes</h2>
          <img id="authorImage" src="images/author.jpeg">
          <p>My Name is Travis Manchee, I am a software engineer undergrad at the University of Calgary's Schulich
            School of Engineering. EZ Recipes is my submission for SENG513 assignment 1. I chose to create EZ Recipes
            because like many students, I love to eat amazing homemade food but generally lack the experience and
            skills required for many recipes. As a result I have come to collect recipes that are both easy to make
            and well received at dinner parties.
