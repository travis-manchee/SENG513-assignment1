                  <tr><td>My Name is Travis Manchee, I am a software engineer undergrad at the University of Calgary's Schulich
                      School of Engineering. EZ Recipes is my submission for SENG513 assignment 1. I chose to create EZ Recipes
                      because like many students, I love to eat amazing homemade food but generally lack the experience and
                      skills required for many recipes. As a result I have come to collect recipes that are both easy to make
                      and well received at dinner parties.
